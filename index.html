        <div class="subheading mb-5">SociologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, I am an 18-year-old student at the University of California Riverside. I am a first-year in college and is majoring in Sociology. I am from Los Angeles, California, and was born and raised here. I am the oldest child out of three. I have two younger siblings. I have a younger brother who is a junior in high school and also a younger sister who is in the seventh grade. Being the oldest child has many responsibilities and pressure to be a good role model for the rest of your siblings. I am also the first generation to attend a 4-year university so there is a lot of pressure for me to do well and succeed in life so I can create a good path for the rest of my siblings. 
<br><br>

        Additionally, as I have said before I am a sociology major. Many people do not know what sociology is but it is a very interesting major. Sociology is the study of people kind of like psychology but psychology is more so about the brain and why people think this way. Sociology focuses more on the actions of people from a broader perspective. This major really caught my attention when I was applying for college because this is a broad major and I can do anything with this major. Also, I was really interested in doing a major that works with people. I wanted to major in psychology but I found sociology more intriguing because it deals with the actions of people and why people act in a certain way in a situation and acts another way in a different situation.
<br><br>

         For now, I am majoring in sociology as a freshman in college but along the way I think I am going to change my major to communications sciences or disorders or linguistics. I am interested in pursuing speech pathology because it is kind of like therapy but not really at the same time. Speech pathology helps with people who need help with speech or language problems. I want to work in the medical field and nursing or being a doctor does not really interest me. Speech pathology really caught my attention because I am able to help others and still work in the medical field. It is like therapy but not and I want to find a career where I am able to work with people and engage in a conversation. Also this career is what I want to pursue as of right now but this can always change because life always changes so you never know. Also, I think working in the medical field is also the most stable job because there is more of wanted jobs in the medical field. Last but not least, I enjoy talking to others and helping others so at the same time I think that this career is something that I will enjoy. Additionally, I feel like this career is something that interests me the most because there is no needles or blood involved because I do not like those things which is why nursing or being a doctor was not a choice for me.
